# public-good-game-smart-contract
 A smart contract built to enable public good game research experiments on the blockchain.

 I originally coded this on Replit, which had a template for automatically hosting it and everything. It was super convenient. I only downloaded the contract file and reuploaded it here.

 The repo for the web app I built to interact with the smart contract is [here](https://github.com/samihan-m/public-good-game-dapp).
